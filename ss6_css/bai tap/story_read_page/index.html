<a href="#part2">OF SEXUAL UNION</a>

<p id="preface">In the literature of all countries there will be found a certain number of works treating especially of
    love. Everywhere the subject is dealt with differently, and from various points of view. In the present publication
    it is proposed to give a complete translation of what is considered the standard work on love in Sanscrit
    literature, and which is called the 'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,' or Aphorisms on Love, by Vatsyayana.</p>

<p>While the introduction will bear with the evidence concerning the date of the writing, and the commentaries written
    upon it, the chapters following the introduction will give a translation of the work itself. It is, however,
    advisable to furnish here a brief analysis of works of the same nature, prepared by authors who lived and wrote
    years after Vatsya had passed away, but who still considered him as a great authority, and always quoted him as the
    chief guide to Hindoo erotic literature</p>

    PART I <br>
    In the beginning, the Lord of Beings created men and women, and in the form of commandments in one hundred
    thousand chapters laid down rules for regulating their existence with regard to Dharma,[1] Artha,[2] and Kama.[3]
    Some of these commandments, namely those which treated of Dharma, were separately written by Swayambhu Manu; those
    that related to Artha were compiled by Brihaspati; and those that referred to Kama were expounded by Nandi, the
    follower of Mahadeva, in one thousand chapters.

    Now these 'Kama Sutra' (Aphorisms on Love), written by Nandi in one thousand chapters, were reproduced by
    Shvetaketu, the son of Uddvalaka, in an abbreviated form in five hundred chapters, and this work was again similarly
    reproduced in an abridged form, in one hundred and fifty chapters, by Babhravya, an inhabitant of the Punchala
    (South of Delhi) country. These one hundred and fifty chapters were then put together under seven heads or parts
    named severally</p>

    PART II <br>
    In these unequal unions, when the male exceeds the female in point of size, his union with a woman who is
    immediately next to him in size is called high union, and is of two kinds; while his union with the woman most
    remote from him in size is called the highest union, and is of one kind only. On the other hand when the female
    exceeds the male in point of size, her union with a man immediately next to her in size is called low union, and is
    of two kinds; while her union with a man most remote from her in size is called the lowest union, and is of one kind
    only.

    In other words, the horse and mare, the bull and deer, form the high union, while the horse and deer form the
    highest union. On the female side, the elephant and bull, the mare and hare, form low unions, while the elephant and
    the hare make the lowest unions.

    There are then, nine kinds of union according to dimensions. Amongst all these, equal unions are the best, those of
    a superlative degree, i.e., the highest and the lowest, are the worst, and the rest are middling, and with them the
    high[33] are better than the low.

    There are also nine kinds of union according to the force of passion or carnal desire, as follows:</p>
